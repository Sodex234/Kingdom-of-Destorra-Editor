# Kingdom of Destorra Editor
Kingdom of Destorra is a medieval RPG, developed by a small team - and the community.
There is an editor and a client, but the server is kept private to prevent cheating.

This is the editor. It allows for map and script creation, that can be imported into the main game.
It originally was a duplicate of the main game, so the rendering and save / loading is the same.
